!!! CV to be updated soon !!!

<h1>Background and Education</h1>
I was born in the Basque Country and grew up in Le Morvan. I have been a beginner surfer for the last 8 years, I love to talk about Daft Punk and Cinema. I did my undergraduate degree of Earth and Environmental Sciences at <a href="https://ufr-svte.u-bourgogne.fr">Université de Bourgogne</a>. I learned geology and observed a lot of limestones. For my masters I moved to Nantes, to study planetary sciences (<a href="https://sciences-techniques.univ-nantes.fr/formations/masters/master-stpe">Earth and planets master</a>) and work closely with the <a href="https://lpg-umr6112.fr">Laboratoire de Planétologie et Géosciences</a> (LPG). My masters years coincided with the covid years but I had the chance to work with great colleagues that introduced me to numerical modelling and geodynamics. As a first short internship, I tried to constrain the composition of the Moon's mantle from electrical conductivity perspective with Olivier Verhoeven . The following year, a longer internship with Gaël Choblet, Antoine Bezos and Mathilde Kervazo, we investigated the influence of planet sizes on melting and effeciency of the latter on global heat transfer using the covection code OEDIPUS. 

That leads me to my current position, as a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth-environmental-sciences">School of Earth and Environmental Sciences</a> in Cardiff University. I am working with Prof. J. Huw Davies, James Panton, Morten Andersen and Don Porcelli on the mantle convection code TERRA. My current research focuses on understanding He and Ar constraints in the context of mantle dynamics. [Go to my latest posts]({{ '/research' | absolute_url }}) to see what I am up to! My thesis is due next next autumn, so I will be soon looking for a post-doc, if you are interseted in my work, feel free to message me!

<h1>Teaching</h1>
During my time in Cardiff, I have had the opportunity to develop teaching skills doing various practicals with undergraduates and master students:

- 1st Year Undergraduate: Introduction to ArcGIS software practicals (9 weeks, 4 groups, 3 iterations)  
- 1st Year Undergraduate: Introduction to structural geology and mapping practicals (7 weeks, 2 groups, 1 iteration)
- 2nd Year Undergraduate: Hydrology and Geomorphology practicals (Excel, GIS, Field Work) (1 iteration)
- 4th Year integrated master: introduction to Python and numerical modelling (Spyder) (7 weeks, 1 iteration)
